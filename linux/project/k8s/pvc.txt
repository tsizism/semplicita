The PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage 
that requires a PersistentVolume (PV) 
with your desired specification (such as size or mount options) from Kubernetes and 
binds it to Pods where you can mount it as a volume.

Retain reclaim policy keeps the data in a PersistentVolume when the attached PersistentVolumeClaim is deleted

hostPath PersistentVolume (PV) type used to test a single node,
nfs PV type is used to test multiple node clusters.

Using PVCs in Pods
Once you create a PVC use it in a POD definition file by specifying the PVC Claim name under persistentVolumeClaim section in the volumes section like this:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
        name: mypd
  volumes:
    - name: mypd
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: myclaim


The same is true for ReplicaSets or Deployments. Add this to the pod template section of a Deployment on ReplicaSet.
