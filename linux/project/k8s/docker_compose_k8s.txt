You have a docker-compose.yml file which cannot be used with the kubectl command. 
How would you process the file to run with the kubectl command?
Run kompose convert followed by kubectl apply -f <files>.


Why would you use the kompose up command as opposed to kompose convert?
If you want to check the availability of resources Kubernetes will build before deploying them with convert.
