Instead of deploying containers, we deploy pods and a pod can have one or more container in it, and a pod can also have one or more service in it.
So the basic unit within a Docker swarm is a container, in our case, Docker containers.
But in Kubernetes, the basic unit in a Kubernetes cluster is actually called a pod.

k get deployments 
k get svc

k logs <pod>

k delete svc broker-service
k expose deployment broker-service --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080 --target-port=8080

get deploy,svc,po

Ingress:
k apply -f k8s/fe.yml 
k apply -f ingress.yml 

$cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost front-end.info broker-service.info
